		%p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to its complex nature as well as its broad and indiscriminate effects, the current recession can be particularly devastating to many citizens. In attempting to alleviate the burden on the City of Charlotte, it is necessary to approach the issue from multiple perspectives.

		%h3	Charitable Needs
		%p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the creation of The Corners Society in 2009, it was unanimously agreed upon that the present economic crisis and its direct impact on the citizens of Charlotte must be the focus of our immediate efforts. The “Great Recession” is a world wide issue, but its effects are most intensely felt at the community level. Charlotte is no exception.

		%h3 Volunteering
		%p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By actually getting into the community and physically assisting Target Charities, The Corners Society helps to alleviate that over-stressed social infrastructure that frequently has limited personnel and financial resources.
